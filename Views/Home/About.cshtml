                        During multiple years of study, researchers have excavated more than 1,000 mummies and collected data in field notes, spreadsheets, and simple databases about each mummy’s
                        location, physical orientation in the ground, burial depth, hair color, wrapping (including information about the textiles used), gender, age, bone (including skull and teeth)
                        dimensions, items accompanying the mummy, and more.

                        And, of course, there are many, many photographs. Offsite, researchers have performed a variety of analyses on the items
                        excavated including carbon dating, DNA sequencing, and others.
